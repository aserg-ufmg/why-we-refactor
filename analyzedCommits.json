However, there are use cases that would benefit from\nbeing able to supply a reduced set of attributes and still have the\nannotation synthesized properly.\n\nThis commit refines the validation mechanism in\nMapAnnotationAttributeExtractor so that a reduced set of attributes may\nbe supplied. Specifically, if an attribute is missing in the supplied\nmap the attribute will be set either to value of its alias (if an alias\nvalue configured via @AliasFor exists) or to the value of the\nattribute's default value (if defined), and otherwise an exception will\nbe thrown.\n\nFurthermore, TransactionalTestExecutionListener has been refactored to\ntake advantage of this new feature by synthesizing an instance of\n@TransactionConfiguration solely from the default values of its\ndeclared attributes.\n\nIssue: SPR-13087\n","motivations":["EM: Remove duplication"],"others":["Automated","ide: Eclipse"]},{"id":1121377,"repository":"https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS.git","sha1":"797fb7fc1415ac0ebe9a8262677dfa4462ed6cb4","author":"Artem Tikhomirov","message":"MPS-21033 Support NodeAttributes in TextGen.\n","motivations":["EM: Facilitate extension"],"others":["Partially automated","ide: Unknown"]},{"id":1120196,"repository":"https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android.git","sha1":"4bfe164cc8b4556b98df18098b162e0a84038b32","author":"Danilo Ercoli","message":"Simplify Tabs tracking by using the onPageSelected() callback.

mechanism for input superstep and graph\n\nSummary: This code adds the ability to adaptively control the out-of-core mechanism for graph data structure at run-time during input/output superstep and computation superstep. Basically, the implemented mechanism monitors the amount of available free memory in a separate thread. If there is not enough memory, the code adjusts the number of partitions in memory, and spills a series of partitions/buffers to disk. Also, if the amount of free memory is more than expected, some of the on-disk partitions are brought back to memory. Additionally, if amount of free memory is marginal, the mechanism mocks the memory usage by gradually bringing partitions to memory.\n\nTest Plan:\nmvn clean verify\nUnit tests added to giraph-core\nEnd-to-end test added to giraph-example\nRunning the code on PageRank on a large graph and not getting OOM failures.\n\nReviewers: maja.kabiljo, sergey.edunov, avery.ching, dionysis.logothetis\n\nReviewed By: dionysis.logothetis\n\nDifferential Revision: https://reviews.facebook.net/D40563\n","motivations":["MA: Move attribute to appropriate class"],"others":["Manual","ide: Unknown"]},{"id":1152218,"repository":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-roo.git","sha1":"0bb4cca1105fc6eb86e7c4b75bfff3dbbd55f0c8","author":"Juan Carlos García","message":"ROO-3648: Updating Generic Methods support to use with MethodMetadata and MethodMetadataBuilder\n","motivations":["UA: Move up common attributes","UM: Move up common methods"],"others":["Manual","manual: Lack of trust","ide: Unknown"]},{"id":1152033,"repository":"https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj.git","sha1":"12602650ce99f34cb530fc24266c23e39733b0bb","author":"Ross Nicoll","message":"Modify data object serialization/deserialization to provide extension hooks\n\nMake headerParsed, transactionParsed, headerBytesValid and transactionBytesValid protected so subclasses in the same package can access them.\n\nAdd constructor for use when a block is contained within another object (i.e. AuxPoW header)\n\nMake headerParsed, transactionParsed, headerBytesValid and transactionBytesValid protected so subclasses in the same package can access them.\n\nAdd constructor for use when a block is contained within another object (i.e. AuxPoW header)\n\nAdd parseTransactions() method which takes in a payload offset, so block parsers can indicate that transactions do not start at byte 80.\n\nExtract common interface from BitcoinSerializer to support alternative serializers, as well as dummy serializer for message classes which do not have their network parameters.\n\nThread BitcoinSerializer through messages in place of existing parseLazy and parseRetain properties.\n\nInsert dummy serializer into message subclasses when deserialized by Java.\n\nReplace calls to construct Block/Transaction classes from payloads, with calls to MessageSerializer, so alternative formats can be supported elegantly.\n\nMake headerParsed, transactionParsed, headerBytesValid and transactionBytesValid protected so subclasses in the same package can access them.\n\nAdd constructor for use when a block is contained within another object (i.e. AuxPoW header)\n\nAdd parseTransactions() method which takes in a payload offset, so block\nparsers can indicate that transactions do not start at byte 80.\n","motivations":["EM: Enable overriding","EM: Introduce factory method"],"others":["Automated","ide: NetBeans"]},{"id":1152672,"repository":"https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project.git","sha1":"837d1a74bb7d694220644a2539c4440ce55462cf","author":"Simone Bordet","message":"473624 - ProxyServlet.Transparent / TransparentDelegate add trailing slash before query when using prefix.\n","motivations":["EM: Extract reusable method"],"others":["Partially automated","ide: Unknown"]},{"id":1151782,"repository":"https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand.git","sha1":"e95aa8ab32a0334b9c941799060fd601297d05e4","author":"GaidamakUA","message":"Menu button for favourites items.
